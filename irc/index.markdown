# PHP-FIG IRC

An IRC channel is available, in addition to the [mailing list][mailing], to
hold more real-time discussions, bounce ideas off of one another, and to chat
between ourselves in a slightly more informal setting.

## Channel Location

The channel is located on [Freenode][freenode] (irc.freenode.net)
and is called [#phpfig][irc-channel].

## Web Interface

A <a href="/irc/fullscreen/" target="_blank">full-page web interface</a> is also available (opens in a new tab).

  [mailing]: http://groups.google.com/group/php-fig/
  [freenode]: http://www.freenode.net
  [irc-channel]: irc://freenode.net/phpfig
