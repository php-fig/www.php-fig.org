			<h2>What does FIG stand for?</h2>

			<p>The FIG stands for Framework Interoperability Group. The name until recently was “PHP Standards Group” but this was somewhat inaccurate of the intentions of the group.</p>

			<h2>What are the aims of the PHP-FIG?</h2>

			<p>The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main audience is each other, but we’re very aware that the rest of the PHP community is watching. If other folks want to adopt what we’re doing they are welcome to do so, but that is not the aim. Nobody in the group wants to tell you - Joe Programer - how to build your application.</p>

			<h2>What standards have been passed so far?</h2>

			<dl>
				<dt><a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0</a></dt> 
				<dd>Aims to provide a standard file, class and namespace convention to allow plug and play code.</dd>
				<dt><a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md">PSR-1</a></dt> 
				<dd>Aims to ensure a high level of technical interoperability between shared PHP code.</dd>
				<dt><a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">PSR-2</a></dt>
				<dd>Provides a Coding Style Guide for projects looking to standardise their code.</dd>

			<h2>Who appointed you to make these decisions?</h2>

			<p>The entire group is self appointed. It may not be “official” but if that was the case who would do the appointing? If the group was all entirely official this would be the <em>Zend Interoperability Group</em>, which might not be as fair as letting various projects come together to make decisions as a community. Anyone can apply for membership and if they get enough votes they’ll be a member of the group.</p>

			<h2>Do voting members have to comply to the standards?</h2>

			<p>No. Becoming a voting member on the PHP-FIG in no way forces a member or project to implement every - or any - accepted PSR&rsquo;s. It is assumed that some will be picked up, but in no way required.</p>

			<h2>Can I get involved?</h2>

			<p>Absolutely. Anybody who subscribes to the Google Group is part of the PHP-FIG, but only voting members get a to vote - simple right? If you or your project want to become a voting member simply send an email to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/php-fig/">mailing list</a> requesting membership (see <a href="/">homepage</a> for more details).</p>

			<h2>Should I contact my representative to get involved?</h2>

			<p>If you think that your project would benefit from implementing PSRs and you want to have a say in the development of future standards then you certainly should get involved.</p>

			<h2>Who gets the vote - the individual or the framework/project?</h2>

			<p>Multiple members can represent a single project, but that project will only get one vote. A member can represent multiple projects, but that member will still only get one vote.</p>

			<h2>Who should initiate/close voting?</h2>

			<p>The rules are all described in the <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/bylaws/001-voting-protocol.md">Voting Protocol Bylaws</a>.</p>

			<h2>Why have [FRAMEWORK X] not been voted into the group?</h2>

			<p>Every single vote has a number of reasons for and against voting. No explicit guideline or explicit set of rules has been set out. Some vote for everyone, some vote for their friends, some vote for projects with a certain size or reputation. In reality sizes of all projects have been accepted, from the large and extremely well known (Zend Framework 2 &amp; Drupal) to the considerably smaller (<a href="http://pyrocms.com/">PyroCMS</a>). If a project you use is not represented they have either not applied, or were not involved enough in discussion prior to submitting their vote that they have not been voted in. They can try again later of course.</p>

			<h2>Why are there non-frameworks as voting members?</h2>

			<p>It was quickly discovered that CMS, applications, package developers, etc have as much to add as the frameworks themselves. The idea is to get a cross-section of the eco-system and not JUST one specific group of developers. Having the implementers working alongside the people creating packages and the people developing systems with the frameworks are all of equal importance.</p>

			<h2>I use [FRAMEWORK X] which is a voting member, yet I&rsquo;ve never heard about the PHP-FIG until now. How are they representing their community?</h2>

			<p>Framework developers have a multitude of factors to consider when planning the roadmap for their products and they need to take their community into account when they do this. Factors like features, functionality, style guide, minimum requirements, etc are all subject to change in any new version and each project makes their own decisions. How they involve their communities in decision making is entirely up to them, not the FIG.</p>
