This repository holds the public facing website for the group. 

.. note::
   @TODO add more substance fleshing this out as well along with the website, so the methods 
   to build the website are transparent to the group as a whole for anyone that wishes to 
   dig in here a little :) e.g. Build script notes and tools used etc.
