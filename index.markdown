### Requesting Membership

You do not need to be a voting member to participate in discussion on the [mailing list][mailing-list].

To become a voting member, you must send an email to the [mailing list][mailing-list].

  [mailing-list]: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/php-fig

The subject line should read: `Membership Request: {$your_name} ({$project_name})`

The body should include your name, the name of (and link to) the project you represent, and other details you feel are relevant.
